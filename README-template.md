## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Learned more about positioning in CSS using flexbox and Grid and using JavaScript to change the text on screen upon clicking a link.
Also learned how to work with JSON data in HTML, but been unsuccesfull to import JSON data from an external file.

### Continued development

Continue projects to become more "fluent" in writing HTML, CSS and JS. New learning curves would include React and jQuery. Using external JSON data.

### Useful resources

- [BEM 101 - CSS-Tricks] ([https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/]) 
- [Reading JSON file in Javascript] ([https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-read-json-file-in-javascript/]) - This clearly explains the options but unfortunately I got the CORS error message even when I loaded in Visual Studio's internal server.
